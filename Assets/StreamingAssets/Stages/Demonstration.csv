%% HEADERS %%
%The first 2 lines above are headers. They must never be removed!
%StageId = Stage Identification (min: 1, max: 9999)
%Phase = Phase Identification (min: 1, max: 4)
%Level = Level Identification (min: 1)
%ObjectSpeedFactor = Controls the objects speed (min: 1.0. max: 3.0)
%Height/Size Increment = Incremental value that controls player performance during a level (min: 0.0. max: 1.0)
%Height/Size Up Threshold = Number of successes required to increase maximum height/sizes by Height/Size Increment during a level (min: 1. max: 5)
%Height/Size Down Threshold = Number of failures required to decrease maximum height/sizes by Height/Size Increment during a level (min: 1. max: 5)
%Loops = Number of times to repeat a script (min: 1, max: 99)

%% COMMANDS %% 
%Commands always comes after the headers
%Template: ObjectType;DifficultyFactor;PositionYFactor;PositionXSpacing
%ObjectType = Command to spawn object (Target | Obstacle | Relax)
%Target DifficultyFactor => Modifies Height (min: 0.0, max: 1.0)
%Obstacle DifficultyFactor => Modifies Size (min: 0.0, max: 1.0)
%PositionYFactor = INSpiratory object or EXPiratory object (INS = 1, EXP = -1)
%PositionXSpacing = Distance from the last spawned object in unity's metric unit
%Relax command does not use DifficultyFactor and PositionYFactor
